My intro website details:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////PLANNING: 

1. Website about: me

2. Information about me: 

Title: 
Jason Nelemans
02-02-1994 | Amsterdam, Netherlands 

Nicknames: 
They've given me a few nicknames over the years. None of them appropriate here. 
Call me as you like, but I respond most to Jason ;) 

My opinions: 
Favourite recreational events? 
Hang with friends and family, go to the cinema, read a book/manga or watch a tv show/anime. 
When I get a chance to: travel. But also... DANCING! 

So you like movies? Favourite cinematic universe? 
!!Star Wars!! but I'm unhappy with Disney Star Wars... I shed tears over its lost potential. 

Previous employment? 
I'm master of the oddjobs! I've been a waiter, bartender, labourer, builder, 
delivery driver, farm hand and teacher in different parts of the world. 

Why coding? 
Looking for something stable with good future perspectives and decent salary. 
And because it's fun;) 

A recipe for a happy life? 

Is there such a thing? 
Just kidding;) 
Eternal mantra: Don't worry. Be happy. Take it easy. 
Or try at least :) It's all in the head. 

Plot twist: 
Inside my head:
INSERT CRAZY IMAGES OF HELL AND SUFFERING.
